# Jira Sprint Issue Fetcher

A Python command-line tool that retrieves issues from the current Jira Cloud sprint and organizes them by engineer, making it easy to add notes. I use it as a draft for standup notes.

Expected output example:
```
PI1 Sprint 2

Anna Example
  https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/PRJ-1256
  https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/PRJ-1254
  
Charlie Doe
  https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/PRJ-1295
```  
It uses Jira's REST API with HTTP Basic Authentication and is configured via a YAML file.

## Note 
This became the VIBE coding experiment. The process took much longer than I expectedâ€”probably because I need to improve my prompt-writing skills. For comparison, semi-traditional coding with Copilot support took me about 20 minutes and resulted in the most concise code (see: sprint_fetcher_copilot.py), whereas vibe-coding took 2 hours. Eventually, I even used existing code to generate prompts with AI (still with limited success). 
The initial commit for the README file was fully generated by AI, and this worked great.

### Copilot
initial script written in semi-traditional manner in about 20min.

### GTP
In the end, I got it working in GPT-4.1, without making any manual edits to the generated code.

### Claude
Sonnet 4 managed it, but I had to tweak it to use the Agile API to retrieve information about the active sprint, rather than the Jira Rest API as it initially tried. I also had to instruct it to use the same configuration options (which wasn't specified in the initial command) and to disable INFO logs.

Generally, Claude handles editing existing code well.

### Gemini
Gemini 2.5 Pro handled it without any major problems, although it ignored my requirements and added its own inventiveness to decorate the output.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Securely connects to Jira Cloud using your email and API token.
- **Configurable:** Reads all parameters (Jira URL, project key, board ID, days threshold, engineer list) from a YAML config file.
- **Status & Recency:** Filters issues that are not 'Done', 'Closed', or 'Released', or were updated within the last N days.
- **Clear Output:** The output will display the active sprint name, followed by each engineer's display name and the URLs of their corresponding issues, formatted for easy copy-pasting into documentation platforms like Confluence

## Installation

Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Create a YAML configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) with the following structure:

```yaml
jira_base_url: "https://your-domain.atlassian.net"
email: "your-email@example.com"
api_token: "your-api-token"
project_key: "PROJECT"
board_id: 123
days_recent: 7
engineers:
  - "Alice Smith"
  - "bob@example.com"
  - "Charlie Doe"
```

## Usage

Run the tool from the command line, providing your config file:

```
python sprint_fetcher.py config.yaml
```

Note: you can create seperate config file for each team

## Output Example

```
Active Sprint: Sprint 42

Alice Smith
- https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/PROJECT-101
- https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/PROJECT-105

Bob Example
- https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/PROJECT-110

Charlie Doe
(no matching issues)
```

## Error Handling

- Invalid config or missing parameters: clear error message.
- API failures (authentication, network, permissions): informative output.
- No active sprint: message displayed.
